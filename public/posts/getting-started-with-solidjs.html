<h1>Getting Started with SolidJS</h1>

<p>SolidJS is a declarative JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Unlike other frameworks that use a Virtual DOM, Solid compiles its templates down to real DOM nodes and wraps updates in fine-grained reactions. This approach leads to exceptional performance and a smaller bundle size.</p>

<h2>Why Choose SolidJS?</h2>

<p>There are several compelling reasons to choose SolidJS for your next project:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Solid's fine-grained reactivity system ensures that only the necessary parts of your UI update when data changes.</li>
  <li><strong>Small Bundle Size:</strong> With no Virtual DOM overhead, Solid applications are significantly smaller than equivalent React applications.</li>
  <li><strong>Familiar Syntax:</strong> If you know React, you'll feel right at home with Solid's JSX syntax.</li>
  <li><strong>No Runtime:</strong> Solid compiles away at build time, leaving you with optimized vanilla JavaScript.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Features</h2>

<p>SolidJS comes packed with features that make development enjoyable:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Reactive primitives like <code>createSignal</code>, <code>createEffect</code>, and <code>createMemo</code></li>
  <li>Built-in control flow components like <code>Show</code>, <code>For</code>, and <code>Switch</code></li>
  <li>Powerful stores for managing complex state</li>
  <li>Server-side rendering support out of the box</li>
  <li>Excellent TypeScript support</li>
</ol>

<h2>A Simple Example</h2>

<pre><code>import { createSignal } from 'solid-js';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);
  
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Count: {count()}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCount(count() + 1)}&gt;
        Increment
      &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}</code></pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>SolidJS represents a new generation of JavaScript frameworks that prioritize performance and developer experience. Whether you're building a simple website or a complex web application, Solid provides the tools you need to succeed.</p>
